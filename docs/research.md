Valorant Esports Manager Simulation – Proposal

Gameplay Loops

Short-Term (Daily) Loop: Players act as the team manager, handling everyday operations. This includes managing player training schedules and scrims, setting daily practice objectives, and monitoring player fatigue or morale. Before each match, the manager will conduct match preparation – selecting the team’s agent composition, reviewing opponent tactics, and adjusting strategies. On match day, the player makes real-time decisions such as tactical timeouts or minor strategy tweaks (e.g. altering which site to prioritize) to influence the simulated match outcome. After the match, there’s a post-match analysis phase where you review detailed stats, performance ratings, and a commentary log to identify strengths and weaknesses￼￼. These daily loops give a sense of progression and immediate feedback, as you observe how training or tactical changes impact the next game.

Long-Term (Season) Loop: Over the course of a season, the manager sets seasonal goals (e.g. finish top 3 in a league or win a tournament) and makes strategic decisions to achieve them. This involves team development – scouting and transferring players during transfer windows, managing contracts and salaries, and building a cohesive roster for the long run. The progression is marked by tournament results, league standings, and evolving team chemistry over time. Between seasons, the player navigates off-season activities: recruiting promising talent, upgrading team facilities, and evaluating overall performance against goals. Achieving long-term objectives (like winning a championship) provides a satisfying payoff to the season loop and unlocks new challenges (e.g. promotion to a higher league or qualification to international events). Both loops intertwine – daily management decisions compound to affect season success, while long-term planning (like nurturing a rookie or saving budget for a star signing) trickles down into daily gameplay.

Key Components

Team Building and Progression

Constructing a successful Valorant team is a core focus. Managers start by assembling a roster of five starting players (plus substitutes or academy players) with complementary skills. Each player has attributes (aim, game sense, ability usage, etc.) that improve through training and experience. Over time, players gain experience and progression, simulating growth in skills or game IQ. The game includes a chemistry system reflecting how well team members work together – a roster that stays together and fits well will perform better as synergy builds. Managers must balance developing talent versus acquiring star players. Team roles (entry fragger, sniper, in-game leader, etc.) can be assigned to maximize each player’s impact. As seasons progress, the manager can upgrade team infrastructure (e.g. better gaming facilities, analytics tools) to accelerate player growth and improve long-term performance.

Player Personalities and Morale

Each virtual player is not just defined by stats, but also by a personality profile. Traits like leadership, work ethic, confidence, or tendency to tilt under pressure add depth to management. For example, a player with high leadership can boost team morale, while an easily-tilted player might perform poorly after several round losses. Morale plays a crucial role: winning streaks and good interpersonal dynamics raise morale, leading to performance buffs, whereas losing streaks or internal conflicts can hurt morale and thus in-game performance￼￼. Managers need to handle team talks, one-on-one conversations, and perhaps social media or media interview events to maintain morale. There will be a player happiness system where individuals react to their situation – e.g. a benched player might become unhappy, or a star might demand a higher salary or transfer if morale drops. Effective managers will utilize staff (sports psychologists or coaches) and make smart decisions (rotating players, resolving conflicts) to keep the squad motivated. This creates a layer of human management akin to Football Manager, where understanding personalities is as important as raw skill￼.

Agent Ability Synergy and Tactical Depth

Valorant’s unique strategic depth comes from agent abilities, so the management game emphasizes team composition and ability synergy. Each player has one or more preferred agents, and composing a balanced team of agents is a key strategic puzzle. For instance, you may ensure the team has a good mix of roles (e.g. Duelist for entry, Controller for smokes, Sentinel for defense, Initiator for info). The game simulates how agent abilities combo with each other – such as Kay/O’s suppression working with Killjoy’s lockdown to bolster site holds￼, or Fade’s seize orb combo with Raze’s grenade to secure kills￼. The manager can devise playbook strategies that take advantage of these synergies (for example, coordinating Breach’s flash and Jett’s dash to execute a site). Tactically, the player will set default strategies (default spread, fast execute, slow play, etc.) and can make mid-game adjustments via a coaching interface. In-game economy management is also a tactical element: before matches, managers set guidelines for the team’s buy strategy (when to full-buy versus save). The simulation engine follows Valorant’s credit system￼, so deciding to force-buy in a key round or save for a full rifle round is part of strategic management. Depth is further added by a playbook editor, where managers create set plays (e.g. specific utility lineups or site takes) that players will attempt in simulation. Successful execution of tactics depends on the team’s preparation and the opposition’s composition, rewarding deep strategic planning.

Coaching, Training Staff, and Facilities

Beyond players, managers also recruit a supporting staff to maximize team performance. Coaches can be hired with specialties – e.g. an aim coach who improves players’ shooting accuracy, a strategy coach to develop playbooks, or a mental coach to boost morale during slumps. Training schedules can be customized: a manager might allocate certain days for aim training, VOD review, or ability drilling for specific agents. Staff members provide bonuses; for example, a good coach might accelerate player development or provide insights on opponents. The game also features analysts and data staff who can scout upcoming opponents and provide detailed reports (like identifying an opposing team’s favorite map or site tendency) for match preparation. Managers can invest in infrastructure upgrades – for instance, upgrading the team’s training facility might grant a small stat growth bonus to training, or setting up a team bootcamp house could improve team chemistry. This mirrors real esports org investments and adds a layer of club management. Proper allocation of resources to coaching and facilities will yield better long-term results, emulating the depth of real sports management where a club’s success is not just the players on the field, but also the support off the field.

Scouting and Recruitment (Amateur & Academy)

A robust scouting system allows the player to discover new talent to refresh or enhance the team. The game database includes not only current pro players but also an expansive list of amateur players, generated with varying potential. Managers can send scouts to ranked ladders, collegiate Valorant tournaments, or minor leagues in search of the next star. Each scout will have regions or circuits they are familiar with, and higher-level scouts provide more accurate reports on player attributes and personality. Additionally, the manager can establish an academy team or junior roster. The academy team competes in a junior league (or tier-2 competitions) and serves as a pipeline for developing future talent. You’ll manage the academy in a limited way – hiring a coach for them and checking on their progress – and exceptional academy players can be promoted to the main roster. The transfer and contract system mimics real esports: players have contracts with buyout clauses, free agency periods, and even the possibility of poaching from other teams. You’ll negotiate with player agents to sign new players or renew contracts. There is also a transfer market where other AI-managed teams will make offers for your players, forcing tough decisions on whether to sell a star for a big buyout fee or keep them for competitive results. This component ensures long-term dynamism: teams change over seasons, and finding that next big talent is rewarding.

Tournament Structures and League Systems

The game features a full esports league system modeled after Valorant’s competitive structure. Players can choose to start in a franchised league (like the VCT International Leagues) with a fixed set of teams and season format, or in an open circuit with promotion/relegation (simulating regional Challengers leagues). A typical year might include a regular season (league play) followed by playoffs, and marquee international events. For instance, if managing in a franchise league, your season could culminate in Champions (the world championship). The game will ship with multiple tournament formats: round-robin leagues, double-elimination playoffs, group stages, single-elim brackets, etc., reflecting the variety of real esports events. There is also the option for custom tournaments, so players could set up their own league structure or cup (useful for modders or those who want to recreate historical seasons). Each match in these competitions plays out in the 2D simulation, and success is measured by trophies and titles. Long-term goals are tied to these structures – e.g. win a regional league to qualify for an international Masters event. The presence of a dynamic league system, including international major events, gives context to each match and a bigger picture for the manager to strive towards season after season.

Simulation Engine

2D Match Engine (Valorant Mechanics)

At the heart of the game is a 2D top-down match engine that simulates Valorant games in real time. The engine represents each map from an overhead perspective, with players shown as colored icons or avatars moving around the map. It operates in a round-based format consistent with Valorant rules: two teams of 5, alternating attacker/defender roles, playing a best-of-24 (first to 13 wins) format with a bomb (Spike) plant and defusal objective. The simulation is time-scaled – matches can be watched at normal speed or fast-forwarded – and key moments (clutch situations, Spike plant, multi-kills) can trigger highlight notifications. The engine rigorously follows Valorant’s core mechanics: there is a buy phase at the start of each round where the AI players spend credits to purchase weapons and shields (and any charge-based abilities). The economy system is faithfully reproduced, so teams gain credits based on wins, losses, streaks, and Spike plants, influencing their buying power in subsequent rounds￼￼. During a round, agents move through the map’s lanes, use cover, check corners, and engage in firefights. The outcomes of duels and gunfights depend on the players’ stats (aim skill, reaction time, etc.), weapon accuracy, plus a degree of simulated randomness to mimic human error or brilliance. The engine also factors in vision and information: when one of your players uses an ability like Sova’s recon or Skye’s flash, the simulation will reveal enemy positions accordingly, emulating how gaining info confers an advantage. Map-specific features (like Bind’s teleporters or Split’s ziplines) are also implemented – for example, on Bind the engine knows agents can instantly travel via teleporter from one area to another, which can lead to rapid rotations as in real gameplay.

The 2D visualization allows the manager to observe tactical patterns: you can watch how your default setup spreads across the map, see if players are stacking sites or leaving gaps, and how executes unfold. Each agent’s field of view could be indicated by a cone, and smoke abilities create obscured areas on the map where players can’t see or shoot through unless inside. When the Spike is planted, a countdown timer is shown, and defenders will simulate retake attempts, using utility if available. The match engine runs a physics and probability model for bullets and movement – for instance, a rifle duel at long range uses the accuracy stat and weapon spread to determine hit chances, and cover system reduces those chances if a player is behind a wall (with wall-penetration values for each gun considered). All of this happens rapidly under the hood, producing a lifelike flow of rounds.

Abilities and Gunplay Representation

Every agent ability in Valorant is coded into the simulation with effects that mirror the real game. Gunplay is represented through each player’s shooting attributes and the weapons’ stats. Weapons have proper damage models and rates of fire, as well as economy costs (e.g. Vandal costs 2,900 credits, Operator 4,700, etc.)￼￼. A skilled marksman in the simulation will win more gunfights, especially when armed with superior weaponry, but situational factors (flashbangs, positioning) can sway outcomes. Recoil and spread are simplified into an accuracy rating for each engagement to keep things manageable in simulation.

Agent abilities are what elevate the tactical simulation. The engine classifies abilities into categories: smokes, flashes, recon tools, area-denial, mobility, etc. When an AI agent decides to use an ability (based on situational AI logic and any preset strategies you’ve assigned), the engine applies its effect. For example:
	•	Smoke abilities (Jett’s Cloudburst, Brimstone’s Sky Smoke, Omen’s Dark Cover) will create a vision-blocking area on the 2D map for a set duration. Agents inside a smoke are not visible to enemies outside, mirroring real gameplay. This allows simulation of executing onto a site under cover of smokes. The engine tracks smoke duration and dissipates them accordingly.
	•	Flash and blind abilities (Phoenix’s Curveball, Breach’s flashes, Skye’s Guiding Light) when detonated will affect enemy players’ aim/awareness for a short period in simulation. This is represented by a temporary debuff to the affected players’ accuracy or reaction time. If an AI is flashed, the simulation might have them cease movement or fire inaccurately for the flash’s duration, simulating the effect of being blinded.
	•	Recon abilities (Sova’s Recon Bolt, Fade’s Haunt, Cypher’s Spycam) will reveal enemy positions within their range. The engine then momentarily displays those enemy icons to the team that used the recon, allowing the AI of that team to make informed decisions (like wall-bang through a revealed wall or rotate quicker). For instance, if Sova’s recon reveals two enemies on a site, your simulated team might decide to execute that site knowing the enemy positions.
	•	Mobility abilities (Jett’s Tailwind dash, Raze’s Satchel boosts) are reflected by the agent icon moving more quickly or reaching positions normally not accessible. Jett’s dash in simulation will instantly reposition her a short distance – useful for entry or escape – and the engine will treat that as a sudden movement which could throw off an enemy’s aim.
	•	Area denial and damage abilities (Brimstone’s Incendiary, Killjoy’s Nanoswarm, Raze’s Paint Shells) create zones on the map that inflict damage over time or on detonation. The engine will avoid placing enemy AIs in those zones unless they commit or are trapped, and will reduce health of any agent caught in it per tick of damage. If a simulated agent’s health hits zero from these or gunfire, they are eliminated as in the real game.

Each agent’s signature ability is available each round (often free with cooldown or limited charges) and ultimate abilities require charging via points (gained from kills, objectives, or overtime). The simulation includes ult economy: for example, if one of your players gets 2 kills and plants the Spike, the engine will add points to their ultimate meter. When an ultimate is ready, AI will consider using it in clutch or pivotal rounds. Ultimates have big effects: e.g. Killjoy’s Lockdown will trigger a countdown and then detain enemies in its radius if not destroyed – the engine will simulate the enemy scrambling to destroy the device or retreat, and any caught enemies will be marked as unable to move/shoot for the detain duration. Brimstone’s Orbital Strike will create a high-damage zone; the engine will apply heavy damage to any agent caught in it (likely killing them). By incorporating these mechanics, matches feel authentic – ability usage can turn the tide of rounds just as in real Valorant.

Crucially, the simulation uses a robust AI that considers tactics and teamwork. Agents will use utility in combination (e.g. using a Breach stun before teammates peek a corner). The AI is also aware of the Spike – attackers will try to secure sites and plant the Spike, then defend the post-plant, while defenders will coordinate retakes. Time management is simulated: the engine knows when the round timer is low, attackers will rush to plant or risk losing, and defenders in a post-plant will save weapons if a round seems unwinnable, affecting economy next round. The end result is a strategic simulation that feels like watching a real Valorant match unfold, with all its ebbs and flows from utility usage and gunplay.

Realistic Commentary and Match Logs

To provide feedback and immersion, the game includes a commentary and logging system for matches. As each round plays out, a text commentary (and optional audio commentary) describes key events. This is similar to how Football Manager provides text commentary for its matches, but tuned to Valorant context. For example, the commentary might say: “Round 5: Team Alpha executes a fast push onto Site A. Jett gets an opening pick with a Vandal. Sage from Team Beta trades one kill. The Spike is planted. Breach (Team Alpha) uses Rolling Thunder! Three defenders are stunned￼. Team Alpha capitalizes and eliminates the remaining players. Team Alpha wins the round.” This narrative gives players a clear picture of what’s happening without having to interpret only the 2D dots. Important plays like multi-kills, clutches (1vX situations), or economy decisions (save vs. clutch attempt) are noted.

There is also a detailed match log that records each action in chronological order: kills (with weapon used), ability casts, Spike plant/defuse, etc. It might look like a play-by-play: “Breach stunned 3 enemies with Fault Line; Jett killed Omen with Vandal (headshot); Spike planted by Cypher; … Spike defused by Sova.” This log is accessible after matches for deep analysis.

On top of that, a post-match summary is generated, highlighting things like the MVP of the match, total kills/deaths for each player, rounds won in a streak, pivotal rounds (e.g. an eco round win), and ability usage stats (such as “Skye used Guiding Light flashes 10 times, blinding 7 enemies in total”). This summary might also include a simple match rating or performance score for each player, taking into account their impact beyond kills (first bloods, assists, successful ability usage, etc.). The aim of these features is to give the manager rich feedback to inform their decisions: you might read that your team struggled on defense because “Team Beta frequently lost mid control on Split”, cueing you to adjust your setup or roster roles.

The commentary can be turned on in real-time viewing (making spectating a simulated match more engaging) and will use Valorant terminology to feel authentic (talking about “thrifty” round wins when a low buy wins, or “flawless” when a team wins without losing a player). This adds to immersion and also helps less experienced players of Valorant understand what’s happening in the simulation. Overall, the commentary and logs function as the manager’s eyes and ears, ensuring that even if one doesn’t watch every round in 2D, they can still follow the flow and drama of matches and make informed management decisions.

Monetization Strategy (Free-to-Play)

The game is designed as free-to-play, with no pay-to-win elements – all competitive advantages must come from good management, not purchases. Monetization is achieved through optional content and services that enhance the experience without unfair advantages:
	•	Battle Pass (Season Pass): A seasonal progression system where players complete managerial challenges (e.g. win X matches, develop a player to a certain rating) to earn rewards. Rewards are cosmetic or experiential, such as unique team logo designs, manager avatar customizations, or celebratory animations. A premium battle pass track (for a reasonable price) might provide extra cosmetic rewards or club customization options, but all gameplay remains unaffected for non-payers.
	•	Cosmetic Customizations: Players can purchase cosmetic packs to personalize their experience. This includes things like new jersey designs for your team, skins for the 2D agent icons, or bespoke trophy room decorations. For example, you could buy a bundle of futuristic HUD skins for the match interface, or an exclusive set of team banners and logos inspired by real VCT teams. These customizations let players give their team and environment a unique look, fostering personal attachment. None of these affect simulation outcomes; they are purely aesthetic. (This model is similar to how Valorant sells weapon skins and cosmetics to players, providing revenue without affecting core gameplay balance.)
	•	Data/Analytics Pack: As a premium feature, we could offer advanced analytics or historical data packs. For instance, a “Pro Analytics Pack” might be a one-time purchase or subscription that unlocks in-depth statistics modeling – detailed heatmaps of where kills occur on each map, advanced metrics for players (like clutch success rate under various conditions), or historical comparisons to famous real-world matches. Another idea is a “Historical Legends Pack” which could include legendary past rosters or players (imagine being able to simulate with 2021 Sentinels or other iconic lineups) with permission/license – this acts as a DLC that enriches the database for single-player fantasy scenarios. These packs don’t make the current career easier; they provide more content or analytical depth for enthusiasts who crave it.
	•	Boosters (Quality-of-Life Boosts): To respect players’ time, optional boosters can be offered. For example, a Training Speed Booster might temporarily increase how quickly player stats improve for those who prefer faster progress in a single-player save. Similarly, a Season Sim Boost could allow players to simulate non-critical matches instantly (for those who want to skip ahead) – this is more a time-saver than a competitive edge, since it doesn’t guarantee winning, it just speeds up simulation for convenience. These boosters would mostly appeal to casual players or those in purely offline modes, ensuring competitive integrity (like if online leaderboards exist, using a booster could disable leaderboard eligibility for that save, similar to how some cheats/shortcuts in other games work).
	•	Premium Subscription (Club Membership): A monthly subscription option could bundle various perks for convenience and engagement. For example, subscribers might get priority for new content (early access to newly released agents or maps in the game’s database updates), additional save slots in the cloud, the ability to run online leagues with friends (if such a mode exists) on dedicated servers, and exclusive cosmetic rewards each month. Importantly, any advantage is convenience-based – e.g. cloud save or slightly faster interface, not gameplay performance. This is akin to a VIP membership that superfans might opt into to support the developers and get small perks.
	•	Esports Team Partnerships: Another monetization angle is collaborating with real esports organizations. We could sell official team branding packs – for example, a pack that lets you officially use Team Liquid’s logo, jersey, and perhaps a special “team card” with some history of that org. Fans might pay to deck out their in-game team as their favorite real-world team. The revenue could be shared with those orgs, similar to how games like Rocket League or CS:GO have esports sticker capsules. This both monetizes and strengthens community ties, but again, provides no in-game power benefit.

All monetization will be mindful of fairness. Nothing sold will give better players, higher attributes, or increased chances of winning matches. In competitive management games, maintaining meritocracy is crucial – a manager’s success should come from smart decisions, not from having spent money. The monetization strategies focus on personalization, content richness, and convenience. Regular free updates (new agents, balance changes, etc.) will keep all players engaged, while monetization content provides optional extras for those who want to invest in their experience or support the game’s ongoing development.

Key Features for Launch

A successful launch requires a robust set of features that provide depth, customization, and replayability. Below is a summary of key features planned:
	•	Comprehensive Team Management: Full control over roster and tactics – sign and release players￼, negotiate contracts, assign agent roles, set starting lineups and agent picks for each match. Includes managing a 5-player starting team plus substitutes/academy players, with the ability to swap players between maps or matches.
	•	Real Valorant Data Integration: The game comes pre-loaded with real Valorant esports data: actual pro player names, their skill ratings (based on real performance), and real team organizations from VCT leagues. This means you can start a career managing a real team (e.g. FNATIC or Sentinels) with their actual roster. Regular updates will add new agents and keep player rosters current with transfers and meta shifts￼. (Fantasy names can be toggled for unlicensed players if needed, but emphasis on realism.)
	•	2D Match Viewer and Highlights: The live match engine viewer with pause, play, fast-forward controls. Allows you to watch your team’s matches with full visualization of agent movements and ability usage. An instant highlight replay system will let you jump to pivotal moments (like a 1v3 clutch your player won) without watching the whole match, making analysis efficient.
	•	Custom Team Creation: Besides real teams, players can create their own organization from scratch. You can design your team name, logo, and colors, and start at the bottom of a league or in an open circuit. Custom teams allow creative freedom – you could even import an image for a logo or choose from preset icon shapes and color schemes. This feature is perfect for those who want a personal story, like taking “your team” from unknown to world champions.
	•	Editable Database and Mod Support: Following the tradition of management sims, the game will allow community editing and modding. All underlying databases (agents, players, teams, maps) are accessible through an editor. Players can modify stats, add new fictional players, or even create entirely new leagues. The game will support Steam Workshop (or similar) for sharing mods, enabling community-made scenarios (e.g. a fantasy league or a “what-if” scenario with altered agent balance). This means if the community wants to create a mod for a different esports (like a CS:GO mod or a League of Legends version), the engine could potentially support it via mods. The developer will encourage mods by not encrypting data and providing a guide for database editing. This extensibility greatly increases longevity.
	•	Detailed Player Statistics and History: Every match and season, the game records extensive stats for players and teams. You can pull up a player’s profile and see their kill/death ratio, average combat score, clutch success rate, agent pick frequencies, etc. across the season. There’s a historical stats section that tracks records (most kills in a match, longest win streak, etc.) and even a Hall of Fame for champions of each year. If your game spans multiple seasons, you’ll see past winners of leagues and MVP awards, building a living history in your save. This is analogous to the rich history tracking in games like Football Manager, giving context to your achievements.
	•	Leaderboards and Online Play: While primarily a single-player management experience, we will include online features. There will be leaderboards for various modes – for example, an online ranking for the most successful managers (based on an Elo or scoring system that evaluates championships won, difficulty level, etc.) for those who opt in to share their results. Additionally, we plan a mode where players can join an online league competing against other human managers. In this mode, each player manages a team in the same league and the matches are simulated head-to-head. This could be asynchronous (each player plays matches on their own time and the results sync to a common server) or live scheduled if enough interest. This adds a competitive multiplayer aspect where your management skills can be tested against real people.
	•	AI Difficulty and Realism Settings: The game will ship with adjustable AI difficulty for the computer-controlled teams and managers. A Casual mode might have forgiving AI that makes obvious mistakes in drafts or economy, suitable for newcomers. Realistic mode, on the other hand, will simulate pro-level decision-making – AI teams will adapt to meta, contest you in transfers, and use advanced tactics, providing a serious challenge. There could also be a hardcore “Director Mode” where you have to deal with extra realism like player injuries (e.g. a player could be unavailable for a week due to wrist issues) or strict budget constraints, if players want a deeper simulation of running an organization. Conversely, a sandbox mode could let you turn off finances and just build a dream team freely for experimentation. These settings ensure the game appeals both to casual fans and hardcore sim enthusiasts.
	•	Regular Updates Synced with Valorant: To remain authentic, the game will update alongside Valorant’s patches. When Riot releases a new agent or map, the simulation game will receive a content update adding that agent or map (with balanced stats for management). Real-world Valorant events (tournament results) can be optionally incorporated – e.g. a monthly update could adjust player ratings based on their performance in recent VCT events (much like sports games update player ratings). There might even be in-game news that mirror real events; for example, if a star player retires in real life, the game could prompt an optional event in your save about that retirement. These real-time touches keep the game world feeling connected to actual Valorant esports happenings.
	•	Tutorials and Guides: For accessibility, a series of interactive tutorials will guide players through managing a team. This includes a first-time user experience where you take control of a top team for one match as a demo (with guided steps to make substitutions or call a timeout) and a guided season option that explains each aspect (scouting, contracts, etc.) as you encounter them. Additionally, a built-in encyclopedia (or Valorant Manager Wiki) is included, where players can read about all agents, abilities, weapons, and even management tips (like a glossary explaining what “defaulting” or “bonus round” means, for players who might be new to Valorant’s tactical lingo).

In summary, these features aim to provide a feature-complete management sim at launch, comparable in depth to established sports management games but tailored to Valorant. The blend of authenticity (real data), customization (mods, custom teams), and competitive play (online leagues) positions the game for both longevity and community engagement from day one.

Content Details

Agents (Characters) and Abilities

The game will include all Valorant agents up to the current roster, each with their role, signature ability, and corresponding cost mechanics, staying true to the FPS. Below is a list of agents with their role and signature ability (the unique skill each agent gets for free or on cooldown each round):
	•	Brimstone (Controller) – Sky Smoke: Tactical smoke clouds deployable via a map interface. Cost: 1 smoke is free each round (up to 2 additional smokes can be purchased for credits)￼. Provides long-lasting vision blockers useful for executions.
	•	Phoenix (Duelist) – Hot Hands: A fireball that creates a healing/damage zone on the ground. Cost: Free (one charge each round, refreshes on two kills). Allows Phoenix to self-heal and area deny.
	•	Sage (Sentinel) – Healing Orb: Heals an ally or herself to full health over a few seconds. Cost: Free (1 charge per round). Critical for sustaining teammates; her ability to resurrect (ultimate) is also included in simulation.
	•	Sova (Initiator) – Recon Bolt: An arrow that reveals enemies in its line-of-sight on impact. Cost: Free (cooldown-based, recharges each round). Provides crucial intel; can be shot with varying charge and bounce in simulation.
	•	Viper (Controller) – Toxic Screen: A long wall of poison gas she can deploy. Cost: Free (reusable each round, fueled by a regenerating toxin meter). Creates a large-area sight block; managing her fuel is simulated.
	•	Cypher (Sentinel) – Spycam: A deployable camera that can tag enemies with darts. Cost: Free (one camera available per round). Enables gathering information and tagging opponents (revealing them)￼.
	•	Breach (Initiator) – Fault Line: A seismic blast that dazes all players in a line after charging. Cost: Free (charge recharges after a cooldown). Great for initiating site pushes by disorienting enemies.
	•	Omen (Controller) – Dark Cover: Long-range ethereal orb that turns into a sphere of shadow (smoke). Cost: Free (two charges that recharge over time). Omen can drop these vision-blockers anywhere in range; integral for stealthy plays.
	•	Jett (Duelist) – Tailwind: A quick dash in the direction of movement. Cost: Free (available once per round, refreshes on 2 kills). Gives Jett unparalleled mobility for entry or escape.
	•	Reyna (Duelist) – Devour/Dismiss: Soul Orb abilities to heal or become intangible after kills. Cost: Free (she can use up to 2 soul orbs per round, requires getting kills to drop orbs). High-risk, high-reward self-sustain and invulnerability for short durations.
	•	Killjoy (Sentinel) – Turret: Deploys an automated turret that fires at enemies within 180°. Cost: Free (one turret available, persists until destroyed or recalled). Used to hold flanks or sites by dealing chip damage and info. (Her Alarmbot/Swarm grenades are her purchasable basics.)
	•	Skye (Initiator) – Trailblazer (Tasmanian Tiger): A controllable creature trinket that concusses enemies. Cost: Free (one charge per round). Skye’s signature (prior to rework, her heal was signature, but currently her dog is signature). It allows clearing angles safely by stunning enemies if the tiger hits.
	•	Yoru (Duelist) – Gatecrash: A teleport beacon he can send out and teleport to. Cost: Free (one charge per round, can be reused once). Yoru can set up flanks or escapes by teleporting to the beacon’s location.
	•	Astra (Controller) – Stars (Astral Form): She can place up to 5 stars (which she later activates into smokes, stuns, etc.). Cost: Free to enter Astral Form; stars themselves have a one-time credit cost (e.g. 150 credits each) and once placed, she gets them back each round if unused. Astra’s strategic global presence is simulated by her placing stars during the buy phase which can turn into her other abilities.
	•	KAY/O (Initiator) – ZERO/point: An thrown blade that suppresses enemy abilities in its radius. Cost: Free (one blade each round). This ability prevents opponents from using their abilities for a short duration￼, which the simulation uses to disable affected agents’ signature/utility temporarily.
	•	Chamber (Sentinel) – Rendezvous: Two anchors he can teleport between. Cost: Free (one use per round, placing two anchors). It allows Chamber to play aggressively and teleport back to safety. (Chamber’s Trademark trap and pistol are purchased abilities.)
	•	Neon (Duelist) – High Gear: An ability to sprint quickly (and electric slide once). Cost: Free (activatable with an energy meter that refills each round). Neon’s speed burst is simulated to let her rotate or entry faster than others, changing timing dynamics.
	•	Fade (Initiator) – Haunt: An orb that reveals enemies in line-of-sight as a spectral watcher. Cost: Free (one charge per round). Essentially an info-gathering tool like Sova’s recon but in a different style; highlighted enemies are marked for attack.
	•	Harbor (Controller) – High Tide: A long water wall that he can bend and that slows enemies. Cost: Free (recharge each round). Harbor’s wall acts similar to Viper’s but with different shape and slow effect; useful for site execution cover.
	•	Gekko (Initiator) – Dizzy: A creature ability that blinds enemies it sees. Cost: Free (Dizzy is retrieved after use if not destroyed, on a cooldown). Gekko’s kit revolves around creatures – Dizzy (blind) being signature provides repeatable flashes if managed well. The simulation will allow picking up the creature to refresh the ability￼.
	•	Deadlock (Sentinel) – Barrier Mesh: Throws a device that generates four connected barriers blocking movement. Cost: Free (one charge per round). Unique to Deadlock, this signature creates physical barriers (and blocks abilities) for a duration￼, simulated to obstruct pathing on the map temporarily.
	•	Iso (Duelist) – Double Tap: An ability that, after a short focus, grants a one-hit shield upon killing an enemy. Cost: Free (one use per round after focus). In simulation, Iso enters a powered-up state where his first kill generates a shield that can absorb one hit￼, making him formidable in clutch situations.
	•	Clove (Controller) – Toxic Miasma (hypothetical name): As a controller introduced in 2024, she likely has a signature that deploys a unique area control smoke/gas. Cost: Free (with a cooldown or limited charges). (Exact details would be filled in with official info; for now assume a controller-type signature.)
	•	Vyse (Sentinel) – Hardlight Cover (hypothetical): As a Sentinel introduced in late 2024, possibly a signature shield or barrier (given the name). Cost: Free (one deployable cover each round). (Details to be updated with official agent data.)
	•	Tejo (Initiator) – Stealth Drone: A deployable drone that can suppress and reveal enemies hit by its pulse￼. Cost: Free (one drone per round). Tejo’s kit, from early 2025, focuses on intel and area denial via targeted strikes. His drone acts as a hybrid of Sova’s recon (revealing) and KAY/O’s knife (suppressing abilities) when it pulses, providing significant tactical advantage if used well.

Notes: Ultimate abilities like Jett’s Blade Storm or Sova’s Hunter’s Fury are also present in the simulation, balanced by their point costs (typically 6 to 8 ultimate orbs). We have included all current agents and will add new ones as they release. Each agent’s role classification (Controller, Duelist, Initiator, Sentinel) is reflective of their design and is used in the game’s UI to help managers plan team compositions￼￼. All ability costs (credits for purchase or points for ultimates) match Valorant’s standard, ensuring that in-game economy management in simulation feels authentic.

Weapons and Economy

The game features the full arsenal of Valorant weapons, each with their cost in credits, damage model, and attributes. Proper economy management is critical – you’ll need to decide what guns your team can afford each round based on their credit pool, just like real Valorant where choosing when to buy or save can determine a match￼. The main weapon categories and examples included:
	•	Sidearms (Pistols): Cheap but limited firepower. e.g. Classic (default pistol, free) which every player has each round by default; Shorty (shotgun pistol, 300 credits) for close quarters; Frenzy (auto-pistol, 450 credits) for run-and-gun; Ghost (silenced semi-auto pistol, 500 credits) for higher damage and precision; Sheriff (heavy revolver, 800 credits) capable of one-tap headshots at close range￼￼. In eco rounds, your team might be on pistols – the simulation calculates their lower damage and effective ranges accordingly.
	•	SMGs (Submachine Guns): Mid-priced rapid-fire weapons effective at short to mid range. Stinger (1,100 credits) with high fire-rate but small magazine￼ (great for close bursts or eco buys), and Spectre (1,600 credits) which is more controllable and silenced. These weapons excel in close combat in simulation but struggle at long range.
	•	Shotguns: Devastating up close, poor at distance. Bucky (850 credits) a pump-shotgun that can alt-fire shrapnel at mid-range￼; Judge (1,850 credits) a semi-automatic shotgun that can mow down enemies in close quarters￼. The engine will simulate pellet spreads and damage dropoff – e.g. a Judge is lethal in a tight corridor but weak if the target is farther away.
	•	Rifles: Primary weapons for most gun rounds. Bulldog (2,050 credits) is the budget rifle, featuring a 3-round burst ADS mode￼; Guardian (2,250 credits) is a semi-auto high-damage rifle, great for accurate players￼; Phantom (2,900 credits) is a silenced automatic rifle with higher fire-rate, dealing less damage at long range￼; Vandal (2,900 credits) is a high-power automatic rifle that can one-shot to the head at any range￼￼. The sim differentiates Phantom and Vandal performance (Phantom better for close sprays, Vandal for long taps) to reflect meta choices. These are your staple guns for full-buy rounds.
	•	Sniper Rifles: High-cost, high-impact. Marshal (950 credits) is a light sniper – one shot kill to the head, very cheap option for eco (but body shots won’t kill armored opponents)￼. Operator (4,700 credits) is the iconic heavy sniper, one-shot kill to the torso or head, extremely lethal￼. In simulation, an Operator on your Jett will significantly boost her duel advantage on long angles (assuming economy allows). The engine respects scoping time and accuracy for snipers, so positioning them well matters.
	•	Heavy (Machine Guns): High magazine weapons for suppressive fire. Ares (1,600 credits) a cheaper LMG with a decent rate of fire￼; Odin (3,200 credits) a massive LMG with high fire rate and penetration￼. These weapons are situational – the sim will have them excel at holding down spray through walls or chokepoints (especially Odin’s high wallbang damage), but they cause movement speed penalty and take time to spin up. Useful for specific strategies or if a player’s profile favors them.
	•	Melee: Every agent has a melee (tactical knife) for free, used rarely except for stealth or last-resort. The knife in simulation can be used to silently take out unaware enemies or break objects.

The economy in the simulation mirrors Valorant’s: each round, surviving players carry over their weapons, and both teams earn credits based on round outcome (with loss bonus escalation, etc.). You as manager don’t micromanage every purchase, but you set the strategy (like when to force buy). The AI will buy the best weapons possible given the credits and your guidance. So if you call for a “full buy”, they’ll prioritize rifles and heavy shields (armor) if they have ≥ 3900 credits, or drop weapons to teammates as needed. On a “save round”, they might just buy some Sheriffs or nothing at all, preserving credits for next round. The simulation’s economic logic ensures realism – teams won’t magically full-buy every round; they must manage money￼￼. This adds an important management aspect: stringing together multiple round wins yields a huge advantage, whereas if your team’s economy is broken by losing an anti-eco, you’ll feel the consequences.

Additionally, all utility (abilities) have their credit costs as in Valorant. For example, if your Brimstone wants to use all 3 smokes, the extra two cost 100 credits each￼; Jett’s updrafts cost credits, etc. The sim deducts those from the round’s budget. Smart ability economy is part of the engine: your team might not buy every piece of utility if low on money, just as real teams sometimes go light on abilities to afford better guns. As a manager you could specify default priorities (for instance, always buy smokes on controllers even on a half-buy).

To summarize, every weapon and its cost is faithfully included, and the buying phase is a strategic period in the simulation. You’ll see the impact of good economic decisions when your team can afford superior guns against opponents with pistols – upsets (thrifty wins) can happen, but with lower probability, reflecting the importance of the economy system in Valorant’s competitive balance.

Maps and Unique Features

All official Valorant maps are featured, each recreated with their unique layouts and special mechanics. The simulation engine adapts AI strategies to each map’s specifics. Here’s a rundown of included maps with descriptions and their distinctive features:
	•	Bind: A two-site map set in a Moroccan desert town. Unique feature: One-way teleporters connect areas near A and B sites (A Short to B Long, and B Short to A Lobby)￼. In simulation, agents can use these teleporters for fast rotations or mind-games (a loud audio cue is triggered, which the engine will relay in commentary). Bind has no mid lane, so control revolves around the two main lanes per site and smart teleporter usage.
	•	Haven: An iconic map in Bhutan with three bomb sites (A, B, C) instead of the usual two￼. This unique layout means defenders are stretched thin and retake dynamics are different. The sim’s AI knows to possibly leave one site lightly defended and play retake. Haven’s design emphasizes flank watching and site retakes; plus it features a small breakable door in Garage. Managing triple-site defense is a fun strategic challenge for the manager.
	•	Split: Set in a Japanese city skyline. Its distinguishing factor is vertical zipline ropes connecting lower and upper levels (e.g. in mid vent and A Heaven)￼. Split has two sites with a central tower in mid. The engine will simulate use of ropes for quick high/low traversals; gunfights can happen on these ropes (with an accuracy penalty). The map’s verticality and tight chokepoints mean a premium on controllers (smokes) and coordinated pushes.
	•	Ascent: Located in Venice, Italy. It features a large open mid courtyard and two controllable rotating doors on each site that can be closed by a switch￼. These metal doors, once closed, can be broken with damage. In simulation, closing the door can slow down enemy retakes (the AI must break it or go around). Ascent’s open mid makes mid-control strategies vital; the commentary will often note if a team “takes mid control” because that’s key to splitting the sites.
	•	Icebox: A snow-covered secret base in Siberia. Known for extreme verticality – multiple high crates and scaffolding – and horizontal ziplines (e.g. on B site)￼. Icebox also has two-level plant sites (especially the famous vertical plant on B). The simulation handles this by allowing planting at designated spots (upper or lower). Agents like Jett or Raze with mobility have an edge here, which the AI uses (e.g. Jett taking high ground). The map demands precise utility due to many angles; our engine ensures Sova’s recon or Viper’s wall get extra value here to clear the complex angles.
	•	Breeze: A wide-open tropical island map (set in the Bahamas) with very long sightlines. It has one-way drop doors (a trap door from mid into A site tunnel) and rope ascenders to a high nest￼. The size of Breeze, one of the largest maps, is reflected in simulation by more emphasis on long-range weapons (Operators and Vandals shine). The one-way drop door in mid allows a quick (and silent) drop rotation that AI can use for surprise attacks. Controlling space on Breeze is challenging due to its openness, requiring good use of Sentinels to lock down flanks.
	•	Fracture: A unique H-shaped layout in a remote facility with a cracked dome. Defenders spawn in the center while attackers spawn on either end of the map, effectively allowing attackers to pinch sites from two sides￼. Also has a spawn zipline under the map for attackers to move from one side to the other quickly before rounds. This map’s design is by far the most non-traditional, and the AI will reflect that by often executing splits. Fracture also has interactive doors and ziplines (a one-way drop door at Arcade, like a trap door). The strategy for defenders is more about retake and crossfires. The sim’s commentary might note the unusual spawn positions and will describe multi-directional attacks (“Team Alpha attacks Fracture’s B site from Arcade and B Main simultaneously”). Utility that covers multiple angles (like Breach’s wide stun) is strong here.
	•	Pearl: An underwater city map (set in Lisbon) with two sites and a traditional three-lane setup (A site, Mid, B site). Unique feature: Pearl notably has no special mechanics – no doors, no teleporters – it’s meant to be a fundamentals map. This makes it a good baseline for AI behavior. Emphasis is on taking mid (under the beautiful glass aquarium roof) and coordinating site takes through tight corners. The simulation treats Pearl as a map where raw skill and defaults matter a bit more, given the lack of gimmicks. It’s a good testing ground for how well your team executes basic strategy.
	•	Lotus: An ancient India-inspired map introduced in 2023, featuring three sites like Haven and several new mechanics: two rotating doorways and a destructible door￼￼. The rotating doors (between A-Link to A-Main, and C-Link to C-Main) spin when activated, altering map pathways – the engine simulates these opening/closing with noise and delay, affecting timings. There’s also a breakable wall on the map (at B site) that creates a new route when destroyed￼. Lotus also introduced a silent drop from B site to A tree area (allowing a high to low drop with minimal noise). For the simulation, Lotus is complex: the AI will learn to use rotating doors for rotations or bait plays, and breaking the door/wall is considered in strategies. Like Haven, defense must cover 3 sites, but the map’s compact design and multiple connectors keep it balanced.
	•	Sunset: A Los Angeles-themed map with two sites and a classic urban layout of three lanes (A, Mid, B). Its one special element is a mechanical door between Mid and B Market￼, which functions somewhat like Ascent’s doors. Closing this door can cut off mid for a time. Sunset focuses on mid control – controlling the central courtyard is key to attacking either site. The simulation’s AI will often contest mid heavily on Sunset. The map has no teleporters or gimmicks besides the door, making it another “back to basics” tactical map where using cover and crossfires in the narrow alleys is crucial.

Each map is faithfully recreated in the engine: the callouts (area names) are used in commentary, and map-specific callouts are referenced (for example, “Spike planted at Haven C” or “defenders rotating through Bind’s teleporter”). The unique mechanics (teleporters, doors, ropes) are all implemented with appropriate effects and AI understanding of them. This means your strategy needs to adapt to maps; e.g. picking an Operator on Breeze for long sight lines, or ensuring you have an Initiator on Ascent to help take mid and break door if needed. Map veto or selection is part of pre-match management in tournaments (you’ll go through a map ban phase like real Valorant events, to decide which map is played, adding a layer of meta-strategy).

At launch, we include all current maps. If Riot introduces new maps or rotates any out, updates will add the new map (and you can optionally disable a map if it leaves the competitive pool). The variety of maps ensures the simulation doesn’t become repetitive – each environment requires different tactics, much as real teams specialize or adjust per map. Part of your job as manager is to compose a team composition and strategy suited for each map. For instance, you might have a 6th player you sub in on Fracture because they play an agent that’s particularly strong there.

Positioning and Differentiation

Unique Selling Points

This game positions itself as the first in-depth Valorant management simulator, bringing the pedigree of titles like Football Manager to the esports realm. Unlike generic esports sim games, our simulator is laser-focused on Valorant’s rich tactical gameplay and professional scene, giving it unmatched depth in this niche. Key differentiators include:
	•	Authenticity of Valorant IP: We feature all the real Valorant agents, weapons, and maps with accurate mechanics, creating an authentic simulation that fans can immediately connect with. The inclusion of real pro players and teams (subject to licensing) means fans can reenact or change history – a level of realism not seen in prior esports sims, which often use fictional teams. Being tailored to Valorant allows us to model details like agent ability combos and economy that generic sims gloss over.
	•	Depth of Management Gameplay: This title is designed with the hardcore management fan in mind. It’s not a light mobile tycoon with just superficial features; it’s a deep simulator with granular control over tactics, training, and scouting. It strives to do for tactical FPS what Football Manager does for soccer – an addictive loop of constant decision-making and long-term planning￼. Features like a fully-fledged tactics board for setting executes, or a dynamic transfer market with player form and chemistry, set it apart from simpler “esports team tycoon” games. Essentially, it aims to be the most extensive and comprehensive fantasy Valorant simulator available￼.
	•	Cross-Platform Experience: We plan to release on PC and mobile (with a tailored UI), and possibly consoles. Many competitors are PC-only; having a robust mobile version (with cloud save compatibility) means managers can tinker with their team on the go. The interface is being designed with cross-platform in mind: e.g. streamlined menus for touch on tablets, while retaining depth. This broad availability can capture both the serious PC audience and a more casual mobile crowd. It also helps build a larger community across platforms.
	•	Community and Modding Focus: Our commitment to mod support and database editing means the community can shape the game’s content. This is rare in esports sims. By allowing editable databases, we invite the community to update the game with their own content (say a college league mod, or an alternate reality where ability X is buffed). This not only extends the life of the game but engenders a loyal community akin to the modding communities of FM or other sims￼ (note: the Steam tags even highlight “Moddable” as a desired feature for such sims). We will actively encourage community-run tournaments or custom scenarios sharing. The customization aspect (build your own team, custom logos, etc.) also means content creators (like streamers) can engage their audience by, for example, managing a team of their subscribers and seeing how they fare.

Target Audience and Community Building

The target audience spans Valorant enthusiasts, esports fans, and management game lovers:
	•	Valorant players who love the game’s strategy but want a different way to experience it (perhaps those who enjoy theorycrafting team comps or follow VCT closely) will gravitate to managing their own dream team. They get to apply their game knowledge in a managerial setting.
	•	Football Manager/simulation gamers who might not even be Valorant players but enjoy deep management systems could be drawn in by the novelty of an esports setting. The layered gameplay loops of training, scouting, and competing for titles will feel familiar and engaging to them, just with new terminology.
	•	Esports fans of other games could also enjoy it, as many principles (drafting players, building a team) are similar across esports. It can serve as a gateway to Valorant for them.
	•	There’s also a segment of casual mobile gamers who played games like “Esports Life Tycoon” or other light sims – our game offers them a step up in depth when they are ready for a more serious simulation.

To build community, we will have an online presence with forums/Discord where players can share stories of their careers, discuss tactics, and propose feature ideas. Emphasizing community content (like sharing custom logos or mods) will help players feel part of the game’s evolution. We also intend to incorporate social features – for example, the ability to upload your team’s success to a global Hall of Fame or share a summary of your championship win on social media directly.

The eSports tie-in and streaming integration are crucial. We plan to reach out to Valorant content creators, analysts, and even professional coaches to try the game and stream their experiences. For instance, a popular streamer might run a series “Can I coach a bronze team to win Champions in Valorant Manager?” which could attract viewers. We will integrate Twitch features such as Twitch chat interactions – perhaps viewers can vote on certain decisions (e.g. which player to sign in the off-season) during a live stream, making it an interactive experience. Additionally, a “Streamer Mode” could allow streamers to have custom viewer-named players or teams, increasing engagement.

Esports Partnerships and Real-Time Events

To truly stand out, we will explore partnerships with Riot Games and tournament organizers. The vision is to have real-time event syncing: during major Valorant events (like Masters or Champions), we could have in-game special events. For example, when Champions is happening, the game could update with a scenario mode “2025 Champions – can you take Team X to the trophy?” with the bracket set as in real life. Players can simulate the tournament paralleling the live event. We could even allow users to import the actual match results once Champions concludes as an alternate reality in their save.

Another idea is to use official API data (if available) to give live updates – say a player in real life scores an ace, our game might send a news ticker update or a challenge to replicate that feat in the sim. These kinds of timely updates keep the game relevant and exciting around real events.

If the game gains traction, there’s potential for an esports tie-in of its own – e.g. an official “Valorant Manager World Championship” where top players (managers) compete. This could be done by comparing results in a fixed scenario or having an online league mode where they face off. It’s a meta-esport, akin to how Football Manager has had its own esports competitions￼. This not only promotes the game but ties back into the Valorant community.

Competition and Market Differentiation

Currently, the esports simulation/manager genre is under-served. There are a few titles like Esports Life Tycoon (which is more of a casual sim) or community-driven projects for LoL or CS:GO, but nothing official or as comprehensive for Valorant. Our game will be the first to market in delivering a polished, content-rich Valorant management sim, giving it a huge advantage among fans of the scene. By securing the official Valorant license (or even without, by using clever resemblance), we have content that others don’t – real agent identities and accurate gameplay simulation. Competing products likely won’t match the level of detail in the match engine (for example, generic sims might abstract matches as simple win/lose calculations, whereas we simulate every kill and ability).

We also differentiate by combining two genres: esports management and tactical strategy simulation. The 2D match engine is a big selling point – it’s not just menus and numbers; you can watch your tactics unfold visually, almost like a mini RTS. This will appeal to players who enjoy visual feedback and strategy (somewhat like watching an auto-chess or a simulation game play out).

Finally, by being free-to-play, we remove the barrier to entry. Many management sims are premium priced, which limits casual uptake. Here, anyone curious can download and try. We plan to monetize respectfully as detailed, but the key is building a large player base quickly – which F2P facilitates. This helps in community building and ensures long-term viability with a continuous content model, rather than a one-off purchase. The free-to-play aspect combined with deep gameplay is itself a differentiator (most F2P manager games are very shallow or mobile-only; we’re offering depth for free, which will garner goodwill and word-of-mouth marketing).

Marketing and Community Strategy

We will leverage the passionate Valorant community for promotion. This includes:
	•	Influencer engagement: Getting high-profile Valorant streamers (or even actual Valorant coaches/players) to play the game early. Their validation can excite the fanbase (e.g. imagine a Valorant pro reacting to their own stats in-game and trying to manage themselves).
	•	Community-driven development: We’ll be open about our roadmap and solicit feedback on forums/Discord. This makes hardcore players feel heard and invest in the game’s success (similar to how indie management games cultivate loyal followings).
	•	Tournaments and challenges: Regular in-game challenges (like “International Manager of the Month” where the best performance in a month’s scenario gets recognition) can keep competitive players engaged. We can feature top community managers in a monthly blog, fostering a sense of competition.
	•	Tie-ins with Valorant content: Possibly run ads or content on Valorant news sites, or partner with VCT broadcasts for a minor promotion (even as simple as a shoutout or small segment about the game). As Valorant esports grows, being the go-to sim game gives us a niche akin to how people use FIFA or Football Manager to simulate sports outcomes.

By focusing on authenticity, depth, and community, our Valorant Esports Manager will carve out a strong position in the market. It stands out as a labor of love for esports – built by fans for fans – but with the professional polish of a sports management sim. Our ultimate aim is to create not just a game, but a platform where Valorant’s strategic minds can flourish, experiment, and have fun leading their own virtual teams to glory, all while being part of a growing community that blurs the line between the game and the real esport.
