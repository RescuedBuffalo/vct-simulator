# Technical Design Document

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
  - Mobile-first responsive design
  - Material-UI for components
  - Redux for state management
  - React Router for navigation

- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI)
  - RESTful API design
  - WebSocket support for real-time features
  - SQLAlchemy for ORM
  - Pydantic for data validation

- **Database**: PostgreSQL
  - Stores game state, user data, and statistics
  - Optimized for read-heavy operations

### Core Systems

1. **Game State Management**
```python
class GameState:
    def __init__(self):
        self.team = Team()
        self.finances = Finances()
        self.calendar = Calendar()
        self.tournaments = TournamentManager()
        self.market = PlayerMarket()
```

2. **Player System**
```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stats = {
            'aim': float,  # 0-100
            'game_sense': float,
            'utility': float,
            'leadership': float,
            'clutch': float,
        }
        self.personality = PersonalityTraits()
        self.form = float  # Current form modifier
        self.fatigue = float
        self.preferred_agents = List[Agent]
```

3. **Match Simulation Engine**
```python
class MatchSimulator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.round_engine = RoundEngine()
        self.economy_manager = EconomyManager()
        self.strategy_evaluator = StrategyEvaluator()
    
    def simulate_round(self, team_a, team_b, map_state):
        # Considers:
        # - Player stats and form
        # - Team composition
        # - Economy
        # - Map position
        # - Strategy effectiveness
        pass
```

## 📱 Mobile-First Design

### Responsive Considerations
- Fluid layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Touch-friendly interface with appropriate hit areas
- Bottom navigation for mobile
- Collapsible sidebars for desktop
- Progressive disclosure of information
- Optimized data loading for mobile networks

### Performance Optimizations
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Asset optimization
- Service Worker for offline functionality
- IndexedDB for local storage
- Efficient state management
- Debounced and throttled operations

## 🎲 Game Mechanics

### Player Generation
- Procedurally generated players with realistic stat distributions
- Personality trait system affecting team chemistry
- Form and fatigue mechanics
- Career progression and peak age considerations

### Match Engine
- Round-by-round simulation
- Economy management
- Strategy effectiveness calculation
- Player performance variance
- Clutch situations
- Map-specific advantages
- Player role advantages

### Team Chemistry
```python
def calculate_team_chemistry(players: List[Player]) -> float:
    # Factors:
    # - Personality compatibility
    # - Time played together
    # - Communication styles
    # - Role synergy
    # - Leadership dynamics
    # - Facility contribution
    # - Training time
    # - Off stage drama
    pass
```

## 💾 Data Models

-- Teams
CREATE TABLE teams (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    reputation FLOAT,
    budget DECIMAL,
    facility_level INTEGER

-- Players
CREATE TABLE players (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INTEGER,
    stats JSONB,
    personality JSONB,
    contract_value DECIMAL,
    team_id INTEGER REFERENCES teams(id)
);

-- Tournaments
CREATE TABLE tournaments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    tier INTEGER,
    prize_pool DECIMAL,
    start_date TIMESTAMP,
    end_date TIMESTAMP
);
```
