Round Phase:
Players execute their strategy.
Players navigate the map.
Players selectively use utility.
	If a player uses their utility, remove it from their inventory
		If a player is in range of used utility (regardless of owner) it effects them
			If a player is immune, either via status or team, they are not effected
		If a utility provides information, or lack of, (location of players, etc), the player learns this
			If a player comms this information, all players on their team know this
		If an opposing players sees or hears the utility, they know this
			If an opposing player comms this, all players on their team know this
		If the utility kills a player, they drop their gun and die on the spot
			If a dead player has the spike, they drop it on the spot
Players selectively choose to take duels.
	Note, a duel can be initiated by the player or another player.
		Note, a player can try to run from a duel
	If a player dies, they have a death location and drop their gun
		If a player dies with the spike, they drop it on their death location
Players can interact with the spike
	A player can pick the spike up, it is in their inventory until they drop it, plant it or die (same as dropping)
	If attacking, a player can initiate planting the spike and cannot move, shoot or use utility while doing that
		If they cancel planting, they retain the spike and are free to play as normal
		If they complete planting the spike, they gain an ult point, the team gains 300 creds and the timer resets to 45 seconds
	If defending, a player can initiate defusing the spike and cannot move, shoot or use utility while doing that
		If a player stops defusing, they regain their freedom to move, shoot and use utility and the spike progress drops to 0
If the spike is greater than 50% defused, it will not drop below 50%
If a player completes defusing before the spike explodes, they win the round
	If a player is caught in the blast radius of the spike, they will die instantly
Players can pick up weapons off the ground
	If the player has an item in that slot, they drop it in the same location
Players can drop weapons around the map
	If dropped, the weapon is no longer in their inventory
Defending players cannot pick up the spike
